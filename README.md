# TSP-Genetic_Algorithms

The main goal of this experiment is to solve the **Symmetric Travelling Salesman Problem** using a non-deterministic approach.

Consult **Paper.pdf** to see the contents of the experiment.

This paper describes a **Genetic Algorithm** that uses several **Mutation** and **Crossover** techniques.
